        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, My name is Wynne Tran and am currently a first-year Pre-Business Major hoping to take on a career in accounting. I am currently taking a CS008 class for winter quarter in hopes to better my knowledge and help with my major as well. I am currently 18 years old and was born in San Jose but moved down to El Monte at the age of one. Ever since then, I stayed down in Southern California and have enjoyed it ever since. It was not until college was when I got to experience living out of my area and moved to Riverside to continue my college journey. It was a difficult journey transitioning from my home to a completely new environment. The process was definitely out of my comfort zone, pushing me to new boundaries. Being here made me realize how easy I had it as a kid, taking on new responsibilities such as going to school on my own, doing chores, and overall taking care of myself when I had no one else to rely on. Although it was a tough transition, it slowly became easier to adjust and make new friends who now play such an important role in my life.
<br><br>

        In high school, I was part of many extracurriculars and activities that have shaped me into the person I am today. Several of these clubs or sports included, Associated Student Body, Red Cross, Laurels, Key Club, Tennis, and Track. Being able to be a part of all of these organizations really showed me how to balance my time whether it came to extracurriculars or school. It helped me maintain my responsibilities while still being able to have fun with it. Though I was part of many clubs, the one that had the most impact on me was the Associated Student Body. I was in this organization for a total of three years and had a number of positions ranging from commissioner of media, class vice president, secretary, commissioner of student athletics, and ASB vice president. These positions gave me leadership opportunities that really benefited my overall ability to connect and communicate with others. Although it was very tedious work and never-ending posters, I was able to display my hard work through events that the student body enjoyed throughout the year such as rallies, homecoming, and overall spirit for games. It shaped me into a better leader and helped me with my people skills.
<br><br>

        As of right now, I am attending the University of California Riverside pursuing a Business Major. Although I am not completely sure of what I want to become in the future, I will strive in my classes in hopes of being successful and giving back to the people that mean most to me.
